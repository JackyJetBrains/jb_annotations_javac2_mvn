This repo demos Instrument JetBrains Annotations with Maven.

Tested with IDEA 2025.1 and JDK 17, 24.

IDEA Settings:
Check **Delegate IDE build/run actions to Maven** in the
menu **File | Settings |Build, Execution, Deployment \> Build Tools \> Maven \> Runner options**.

Also, this configuration works with Compiling IntelliJ Designer Forms with Maven.
